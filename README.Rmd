CruzPlot is an R package for creating maps, plotting data, and performing basic data summaries from data files in the "DAS" format produced by WinCruz.

## Installation

You can install CruzPlot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smwoodman/CruzPlot")
```

## Run CruzPlot

To open and run the CruzPlot GUI, run the following code in RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
CruzPlot::cruzplot_gui()
```

## Additional details
The CruzPlot manual can be accessed within CruzPlot (i.e., when running CruzPlot) by clicking the "CruzPlot Manual" tab. It is recommended for new users to read the first two pages of the manual for orientation purposes; the rest of the manual contains section-specific information (formatting requirements, etc.) and can be read on an as-needed basis.

If text or images overlap within the CruzPlot window, please make the browser window full screen or adjust the text size in your browser (e.g., Ctrl - minus ('-') on Windows systems)
