# CruzPlot
CruzPlot is is a utility program oriented to create maps and plot data from data files in the "DAS" format produced by WinCruz.

To run CruzPlot, first download all of the necessary files by clicking the green ‘Clone or download’ button on the right side of the screen and selecting “Download ZIP”. Unzip the downloaded file, and open the ‘startCruzPlot.R’ file in RStudio. CruzPlot was developed using R version 3.4.2 and RStudio version 1.0.143; using other versions could cause errors within the app. Once you open the ‘startCruzPlot.R’ file, click the green arrow next to the ‘Run App’ bottom on the toolbar above the code and CruzPlot will open.
