# CruzPlot
CruzPlot is is a utility program oriented to create maps, plot data, and do basic data summaries from data files in the "DAS" format produced by WinCruz.

To run CruzPlot, first download all of the necessary files by clicking the green ‘Clone or download’ button on the right side of the screen and selecting “Download ZIP”. Next, unzip the downloaded file and open either the ‘server.R’ file or 'ui'R' file in RStudio. Finally, click the "Run App" button with the green arrow next to it. This button is near the top of the 'Source' pane, which likely will be near the top of the RStudio window. 

CruzPlot was developed using R version 3.4.4 and RStudio version 1.1.447. Although unlikely, using other versions of these programs or outdated R packages could cause errors within CruzPlot.
